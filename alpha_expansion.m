function [assignment, T] = alpha_expansion(initial_p, graph, fidelity, lambda, maxIte)
%alpha expansion algorithm to solve penalization by the potts penalty
%INPUT
%inital_labeling = classification to regularize
%graph  = the adjacency structure
%fidelity = which fidelity fucntion to use (default = 0)
%	0 : linear
%	1 : quadratic  
%	2 : KL with 0.05 uniform smoothing
%	3 : loglinear with 0.05 uniform smoothing
%lambda      : regularization strength (default = 1)
%maxIte      : maximum number of alpha expansion cycle (default = 5)
%benchMarking: if true will return the energy and time for the algorithm
%            : stopped after 1 ... maxIte iteration, starting from zero 
%              each time
%OUTPUT
%assignment = the regularized labeling
%T          =  computing time
